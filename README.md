# Rowlist focusBitmapUri offset on first focus on the 2nd row

When we use a custom 9 patch for focusBitmapUri in a rowlist we are seeing that every time the rowlist gets focus the first time, the selector is offset a bit to the left.  Any navigation from there gets the selector in the correct position.

### reproduction steps

first time navigation from 1st row to 2nd
